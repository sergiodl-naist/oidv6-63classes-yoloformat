# oidv6-63classes-yoloformat

This repository is intended to include 63 box bounded classes from the Open Image Dataset downloaded by the `oidv6` python tool.

Also, it includes several scripts to move the label text files to the common folder; and to translate the labels inside them to a Label Index according to the order inside the same `classes.txt` file used to download the images with `oidv6`.
