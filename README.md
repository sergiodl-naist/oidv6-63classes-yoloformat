# Darknet's YOLOv4 Training with Custom Dataset with OIDv6 Tool

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook [YOLOv4\_OIDv6\_Training.ipynb](https://github.com/sergiodl-naist/yolov4-training-with-oidv6/blob/main/YOLOv4_OIDv6_Training.ipynb) as a tutorial for OIDv6 usage to download a custom dataset from Google's Open Images Database project.

With this tutorial you will be able to easily download a dataset, adapt the label annotations to YOLOv4 format, compile Darknet, customize the models to the classes of your dataset, and train the model.

It will give you several tips and notes regarding training and Google's Colab jupyter notebooks.
